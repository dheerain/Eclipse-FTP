# Eclipse-FTP
This is an External Plugin for Eclipse To push the Code to Remote machine directly from Eclipse using FTP.

#Usage
I Have a Project on A remote Unix machine which is quite Slow and  Support SSH Only.
I am not Good With Vim and Love to code on Eclipse.
I Got the Whole Source code on my Windows machine and Set it up On Eclipse but to Compile it I have to use the Remote machine.
So Insted of Copying the Code to A Particular Directory on the Remote Machine using filezilla I have developed this Eclipse Plugin

#Compatibility
Windows Machine only + Eclipse 

# Installation and Configuration 
#Steps
  1.Place the Batch File on your Windows machine (Preferably Eclipse Directory)
